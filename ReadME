DAGGER 2 IN Android? 

1. What is Dependency Injection?

Ans: Suppose class A is dependent on class B,  Then class B is the dependency of class A. 

Like A Car class. Lets think our car needs an engine and a wheet. So lets make the car class

class Car{
  Engine engine;
  Wheel wheel;
  
  public Car(Engine engine, Wheel wheel){
    this.engine = engine;
    this.wheel = wheel;
  
  }
  
  public void drive(){
  }
  
}


So now if we want to make a car in our main method, we have to do it like this. 

class Main{

  Engine engine = new Engine();
  WHeel wheel = new Wheel();
  
  Car car = new Car(engine, wheel);
  car.drive();

}

now the engine may have other parts dependencies to make, like cylender, block etc. So finally we have to write lots of code.
But here comes Dagger . We can simply use daggar and then out car object should look like this. 

class Main{
  CarComponent component = DaggerComponenet.create();
  Car car = component.getCar();
  car.drive();

}
Dagger will create all the necessay parts for the car ,and we dont have to do it.
